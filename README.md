# OpenCV_Contours
This repository contains all my OpenCV projects. All the published code and material in this repository are meant for learning purposes only.

# Contours
Contours in OpenCV is a powerful method to compute all kinds of shapes in a given image. The project "Contours_example.py" demonstrates one of the use cases of contours.

# Polygon_Identification
Identifying the shape of the polygon from a video stream. Working with static images is one thing and working on a series of images from a video stream is another. In this project, I write a code that takes input from a camera, identifies the polygon shape, and displays it on the screen.
